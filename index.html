          <b>Karl Stobbe, Violinist</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Karl Stobbe is recognized as one of Canada’s most accomplished and
          diverse violinists, noted for his generous, rich sound, and long,
          poignant phrasing. As an orchestra director, concertmaster, soloist,
          or chamber musician, he has been an audience favorite in small
          settings and large venues. Avie Records’ recording of Karl performing
          Ysaÿe’s Solo Violin Sonatas was nominated for a JUNO Award, and
          received worldwide attention, including London’s Sunday Times who
          called Karl “a master soloist, recalling the golden age of violin
          playing... producing a breathtaking range of tone colours.” Pursuing
          his life-long love of the music for solo violin, Karl has recently
          created an online concert series featuring all the Sonatas and
          Partitas for Solo Violin by J.S. Bach. He has performed in North
          America’s most famous concert halls, including New York’s Carnegie
          Hall and Boston’s Jordan Hall, and has shared the stage with some of
          the most important and eclectic violinists of our day, from James
          Ehnes to Mark O’Connor.<br /><br />www.karlstobbe.com

          It would be hard to overestimate the influence that the Sonatas and
          Partitas have had on the violin world over 300 years – and many other
          wonderful pieces have been written for solo violin, with reference and
          reverence to Bach. Karl has often thought that it would be interesting
          and satisfying on both an intellectual and emotional level to pair the
          Bach Sonatas and Partitas with some of these other works, to hear some
          of the creativity and beauty that Bach inspired in others.<br /><br />
          With that in mind, the Bach C Major Sonata and Bartok Solo Sonata
          seemed like an ideal place to start. Bartok is deeply inspired by the
          Bach C Major, and beyond the very different soundscapes that they
          employ, the compositional technique and interplay between these two
          great works is wonderful to behold. These two works encompass enormous
          musicality and expression, from the most virtuosic and extroverted to
          the most introspective delicacy. It’s a musical pairing that brings
          out their beauty out in new and unexpected ways.

          2020 saw the start of <i>Karl’s Online Concert Series</i> – a series
          of six concerts where Karl talks about and plays his video recordings
          of all of the Bach Unaccompanied Violin Sonatas and Partitas, paired
          with another piece for solo violin. One of the great things about
          these concerts and the online concert experience is their intimacy.
          Space is limited to ensure there is plenty of chance to talk
          personally, ask questions, learn a few things, and listen to some
          great music.<br /><br />Classical music performers, presenters, and
          audiences are learning to exist in both the live and digital world in
          fun, new ways. Providing an online concert experience as a series, for
          celebrations, or other events, is a refreshing, energizing addition to
          the concert format in a time when our neighbours and fellow music
          lovers can just as easily be from the other side of the world as they
          can be from down the street. Being innovative and exciting online is
          already proving to be just as important as being in the concert
          hall.<br /><br />Interested in attending one of Karl’s upcoming online
          concerts?
