        Even with live concerts starting up again, I still get requests to
        continue with Karl’s Online Concerts. I am planning on doing another
        series, but haven’t settled on a date yet. I have been busy recording
        things with friends (chamber music this time), and am planning on asking
        a few other people if they’d like to participate with their own
        material. If you have requests – now’s a good time to make them (<a
          href="mailto:karlstobbe@gmail.com"
          >karlstobbe@karlstobbe.com</a
        >)!! Otherwise, stay tuned, and hopefully we can have an online reunion
        in the near future!!

        The Bach Celebration concerts that I held in 2020 and 2021 were a whole
        lot of fun, and I enjoyed everything about them – recording them and
        presenting them to friends was such a treat. Of course, the music is
        extraordinary!! I’m in the process of turning them into audio recordings
        that will be available for online purchase, and I’ll post updates on
        that as things move along. I am considering also making the videos
        available, but that has yet to be confirmed. For those of you who’d like
        to browse through the Bach celebration trailers, I’m leaving them up
        below as a little bit of memorabilia from those concerts.

        I don’t think too many people would disagree that, at least on a global
        scale, 2020 will prove to be one of the most unnerving years of our
        generation. For those of us in the performing arts industry, by May 2020
        we knew that concerts, festivals, and income was going to get very thin.
        I usually play 130ish concerts every year. I think that in 2020 I will
        end up having played about 25 live concerts – almost all of those before
        March.<br /><br />Trying to make the best of things, I decided that I
        had the time to invest in another musical project – playing through all
        of the Bach Sonatas and Partitas every week for a year, in recognition
        of their 300 th birthday. Covid took many things from me during 2020,
        but getting to play Bach every day was a gift that I will treasure
        forever.<br /><br />Early in this endeavour I started experimenting with
        a few live recordings that I posted on YouTube. I didn’t own any
        equipment other than an iPhone, so as I got more serious I borrowed
        some. Eventually I realized that making a proper video recording of them
        might be valuable to have, so I bought some real microphones (Telefunken
        M61) and started recording. I learned how to use Reaper (audio
        software), started experimenting with cameras, and learned how to use
        DaVinci (video software). With the help of my fantastic sound engineer,
        Joe Dudych, the sound recording wasn’t too difficult. But the video part
        was a very steep learning curve.<br /><br />After finishing a couple of
        the video recordings, I decided to incorporate other art into a few of
        the videos. Some of that is still a work in progress, but there are
        already a few videos that incorporate visual artwork by Manitoba artist
        Margruite Krahn. You can see some of these on my media page. I really
        love the addition of the visual art, and look forward to doing more of
        them as time goes on.<br /><br />Towards the end of recording I started
        thinking about presenting these recordings as an online concert series
        over the winter holidays. To make a long story short, it worked out
        really well. Zoom is not a particularly good way of doing a live
        broadcast, but it works pretty well for pre- recorded music, and as a
        forum for talking to an audience and engaging with them in conversation
        before and after, it’s an excellent tool.<br /><br />Putting these
        together has been a ton of effort from me and others. Thankfully, I’m
        really happy with the way these have turned out, and it’s exciting for
        me to be able to share my passion for Bach, and my passion for the
        violin with you in this format. I hope you’re able to come, and I look
        forward to meeting you online soon!<br /><br />Karl Stobbe
