          Karl Stobbe is recognized as one of Canada’s most accomplished
          violinists, known for his dedication to excellence on the violin and
          classical music in all its forms. As a concertmaster, soloist, and
          chamber musician, Karl has been an audience favorite in small settings
          and large venues. His diverse career has included performances of all
          six Ysaÿe Sonatas for Solo Violin, all 16 Beethoven String Quartets,
          and all 10 Mahler Symphonies. He feels equally comfortable directing
          an orchestra without conductor, performing as a soloist with
          orchestra, playing chamber music, or giving an unaccompanied recital.
          Noted for his generous, rich sound and long, poignant phrasing, he is
          described by the San Francisco Classical Voice as “an artist with
          soulful musicianship,” and by London’s Sunday Times as “a master
          soloist, recalling the golden age of violin playing... producing a
          breathtaking range of tone colours.”<br /><br />Karl has performed in
          many of North America’s most famous concert halls, including Carnegie
          Hall, Jordan Hall, the National Arts Centre, Roy Thompson Hall,
          Segerstrom Hall, and the Orpheum Theatre. As a chamber musician,
          soloist, and orchestra director, he has shared the stage with many of
          the most important and eclectic violinists of our day, from James
          Ehnes to Mark O’Connor. Avie Records’ recording of Karl performing
          Ysaÿe’s Solo Violin Sonatas received worldwide attention, including
          Gramophone magazine which hailed it as “full of spirit and energy...
          exciting, fearless...” It was nominated for a 2015 JUNO Award for Best
          Classical Album. The year 2015 also saw the release of a live
          recording of Karl, joined by Jonathan Crow and the National Arts
          Centre Orchestra, for the title track of “Cobalt,” a CD of the music
          of Jocelyn Morlock. Karl frequently performs and records new music and
          has been involved in numerous commissions and world premieres.<br /><br />Always
          looking to expand the concert stage, Karl has recently created a
          series of online concerts for digital concert platforms. Distinguished
          by his life-long love of the music for solo violin, this series
          features video recordings of all the unaccompanied violin repertoire
          of J.S. Bach. In honour of the 300 th anniversary of Bach’s famous
          Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, it also explores Bach’s
          influence through video performances of other solo violin repertoire
          of music by Bartok, Ysaye, Prokofiev, Biber, and others.<br /><br />A
          lover of all things violin, Karl completed a minor in Violin Repair
          and Construction while completing his Master’s of Music at Indiana
          University. His passion for the construction and mechanics of the
          violin is an important part of his professional musical life and
          continues to influence his performances and teaching. Karl never
          misses an opportunity to see and play exceptional violins and bows. He
          has given multiple presentations on the history of the violin family,
          violin building and repair, and organized exhibits and lecture
          recitals on rare, fine instruments at various concert halls, art
          galleries, universities, and conservatories. Karl plays on an
          exceptional and rare violin by Nicolas Lupot, in Paris, 1806.<br /><br />www.karlstobbe.com
